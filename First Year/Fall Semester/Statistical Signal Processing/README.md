### Course Description
> This course is on statistical signal processing, at a senior or first-year-graduate level. The goal is to provide the background knowledge necessary to solve typical problems by using methods of statistical signal processing. Typical problems are: parameter estimation of a signal embedded in noise, correct retrieval of a signal message from data corrupted by disturbance sources, spectral analysis, parametric modeling, estimation of random processes, with applications to bio-engineering, geophysics, remote sensing, radar and digital communications.
