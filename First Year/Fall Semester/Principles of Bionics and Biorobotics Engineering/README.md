### Course Summary
> In particular, the “Principles of Bionics and Biorobotics Engineering” module will introduce the wide and interdisciplinary field of bionics and related scientific areas, such as biorobotics, neuroengineering and bioengineering. Bionics aims at gathering specific knowledge through the analysis/modeling of living organisms/ecosystems and applies it to the development of newly inspired advanced devices. Bionics also focuses on artificial systems deeply connected to body tissues, and/or interacting with organisms. The application of bionics principles is nowadays widespread in many engineering sub-fields. During this course, the pillars of bionics and robotics are presented to allow the proper understanding of the whole loop from scientific insights to engineering innovation. In particular, the course focuses on the key principles of biological locomotion, swarm robotics, artificial organs, neurorobotics, neural interfaces with the nervous system, neuroprostheses and their functional evaluation, morphological computation, energy issues, principles of structural bionic design and main manufacturing techniques, as well as the fundamentals of robot mechanics.
