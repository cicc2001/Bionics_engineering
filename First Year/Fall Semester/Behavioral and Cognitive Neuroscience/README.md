### Course Summary
> The "Behavioral and Cognitive Neurosciences" class aims at providing the students with an introduction to general themes in Neuroscience and Psychophysiology. Specifically, the course aims first at introducing the fundamentals of brain anatomy, brain physiology and brain imaging methodologies. Neuroimaging techniques provided cognitive neuroscience with an unprecedented tool to investigate the neural correlates of behavior and mental functions. Here we will mainly review the basic principles, research and clinical applications of positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Solid background in the concepts common to many types of neuroimaging, ranging from study design to data processing and interpretation, will be discussed to address neuroscientific topics, such as perception, language, action representation and motor control.
